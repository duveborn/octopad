Octopus Deploy Desktop Client

Work-in-progress solution to the quirky project navigation web site of Octopus Deploy.

Install the latest release: https://github.com/duveborn/octopad/releases/download/1.1.2/Setup.exe

NOTE: No code-signing certificate yet so you'll need to proceed through the Windows warning dialog to install it.

It will automatically update using Squirrel in the background.
